# Quiz App üí≠
<div align="justify">

Quiz App developed as a study project to enhance my React skills and test users' knowledge on Next.js documentation topics. This project serves both as a learning tool for myself and a platform for users to evaluate their understanding of Next.js


Users can navigate through questions, select answers, and their responses are stored for evaluation. Upon completion, a modal displays their final score, performance message, and a comparison between their answers and the correct ones for review.
